Code for Scraping YouTube Channel Links from Google Search



The YouTube Channel Scraper is a Python script that allows you to extract YouTube channel links from Google search results. With this script, you can automate the process of searching for YouTube channels based on a specific query and retrieve the relevant links.

How It Works
The script sends GET requests to Google search and retrieves the search results.
It extracts all the links from the search results.
The script filters out the YouTube channel links and discards the rest.
It constructs the complete URLs for the YouTube channels.
The extracted YouTube channel links are stored in both CSV and JSON formats.
You can specify the search query and the maximum number of search results to retrieve.
Usage
Clone the repository or download the Python script.

Install the required Python packages: requests, re, csv, json.

Open the script in a text editor and set the parameters:

MAX_RESULTS: Maximum number of search results to retrieve.
query: Search query for Google search. Modify it to customize the search.
Run the script and wait for it to complete.

The script will send requests to Google search and scrape the YouTube channel links. The results will be saved in a CSV file (youtube_channels.csv) and a JSON file (youtube_channels.json).

After completion, you will see the number of YouTube channel links that were scraped and saved.

Notes
Ensure that you comply with Google's terms of service and legal usage policies when using this script.

The script utilizes the requests library for making HTTP requests and the re library for pattern matching.

The CSV and JSON files provide flexibility in accessing and analyzing the scraped YouTube channel links.

Feel free to customize and modify the code to suit your specific requirements.
